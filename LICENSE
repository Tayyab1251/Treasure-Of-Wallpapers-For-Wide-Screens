### Steps to Implement:
1. **Create a new `assets/` folder**:
   - Move all the wallpaper folders into `assets/wallpapers/`.
   - Add any icons for the website (if needed) into `assets/icons/`.

2. **Update the paths in your `index.html`, `script.js`, and `styles.css`** to reflect the new structure.

3. **Push the changes to GitHub** and deploy the website on Vercel.

This will keep the website well-organized, maintainable, and interactive! Let me know if you need further adjustments or any help with deployment.
